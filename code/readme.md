This folder contains three folders and two scripts.

Folders:

    1. Using Classes
        This folder contains scripts to implement neural networks using classes and objects
        Work in progress. Not yet complete.
    
    2. Using Functions
        This folder contains scrips to implement neural network using functions
        This is somewhat complete, and can be used to train a simple neural network of 
        one hidden layer
        Still working on updates to it.
       
       * UPDATE *
       Now has support for multiple hidden layers! Yay!
    
    3. Using GPU
        This folder contains scripts to use numpy arrays and numba for increasing the speed
        Work in progress. Still Incomplete. Very buggy.

Scripts:

    1. sysinfo.py
        This script is used to find the system's information.
        Sample output:
        
            > Python version   : 3.7.2
            > Compiler         : MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)
            > Operating System : Windows
            > Version          : 10
            > Machine          : AMD64
            > Processor        : Intel64 Family 6 Model 158 Stepping 11, GenuineIntel
            > CPU count        : 4
            > Interpreter      : 64bit

    2. loaddata.py
        This script contains the functions related to opening a csv and normalizing it.
